       "The usual ways for telling Emacs to save files in UTF-8 format doesn’t work when saving a file with a “.arc” extension (at least in the version of Emacs I have).  Apparently there was some ancient file archive format that had a “.arc” extension, so Emacs is quite determined to save the file in a binary mode, writing out the Unicode characters in Emacs’ internal representation, resulting in garbage.")
