       "The usual ways for telling Emacs to save files in UTF-8 format don’t work when saving a file with a “.arc” extension (at least in the version of Emacs I have).  Apparently there was some ancient file archive format that had a “.arc” extension, so Emacs is quite determined to save the file in a binary mode.  This writes out the Unicode characters in Emacs’ internal character representation, resulting in garbage.")

       (li () "Click on the first “INS” button (the one at the top).")
       (li (style "width: 30em") "For “File name regexp”, type <code>\\.arc\\'</code><br>(that’s backslash dot A R C backslash single-quote, or else copy and paste it from here to there).")
       (li () "For “Coding system”, type <code>utf-8</code>")
       (li () "Click on the “Save for Future Sessions” button."))

     (p () "Alternately, you can add this to your <code>.emacs</code> file:")

 (setq auto-coding-alist
